# DecisionTreeTitanic

This assignment involves building a decision tree model to classify passengers from the Titanic dataset based on whether they survived or not. The dataset consists of two files, `train.csv` and `test.csv`, which contain the training and test data, respectively. A detailed description of the dataset and the research objective can be found at [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## Dataset

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with features about Titanic passengers and the target variable (`Survived`).
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data where predictions need to be made.
  
## Task Breakdown

**Goal:**
- Train a decision tree model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on the available features.
  
### Steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data as needed. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing data.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Train a decision tree classifier on the training data (`train.csv`).
   
3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained decision tree model on the test set (`test.csv`) and report the accuracy.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict survival on the test data and save the results for further evaluation or submission to Kaggle.
